# Exploiting path delimiters for web cache deception
First, I need to find a delimeter that the server recognizes but that the cache don't. I start by deciding to find a delimeter on `/login`. Using burpsuites provided delimeter list, I load it into the intruder and test `/login§§aa`. I then noticed that `;` was a delimiter for the server because it responded with status code 200 when the request with that char was the payload.

I then tried adding `.js` to the path so it looked like `/login;aa.js` - this added the header `X-Cache: miss`. I assumed it would work on `/my-account` as well - so I made this script 
```html
<img src=1 onerror='window.location="https://0a600086034f87e781fff7ef003e00a7.web-security-academy.net/my-account;aa.js?t=2"'>
```
whiched cached the users page.
