# Exploiting LLM APIs with excessive agency
This one is quite simpe. First, I ask the AI asssistent what endpoints it has access to. It answered this.

```
I have access to the following APIs:
    - Password reset: This allows me to send password reset emails.
    - Debug SQL: This enables me to execute raw SQL commands on the database.
    - Product Info: This provides information about the products we sell.
```
I then asked if it could delete user carlos, but it said it had errors interacting with the database. Then I asked if it could execute my raw SQL command and it could. I therefore sent this:
```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE username = 'carlos';
```
Which deleted carlos from the system.
