# Exploiting a mass assignment vulnerability
First, discover the checkout API endpoint has 2 different methods, GET and POST. The GET parameter reveals another body param, that is not sent using the POST.
The GET endpoint retrieves
```json
"chosen_discount": {
    "percentage": 0
}, "chosen_products": [{
    "product_id": "1",
    "name": "Lightweight \"l33t\" Leather Jacket",
    "quantity": 1,
    "item_price": 133700
}]
```
Sending the chosen discount parameter with 100 when buying gets us the **Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket** and solves the lab.
