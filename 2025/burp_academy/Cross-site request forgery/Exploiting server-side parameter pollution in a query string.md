# Exploiting server-side parameter pollution in a query string
First enumerate website to discover 2 API endpoints: ```/login /forgot-password```
Try to inject # in both, to get an error - we can see that ```/forgot-password``` gives an error once %23 is injected in body params like this:
```
csrf=IaRVBoi2eveydFyZrhKV0Zk2jukjlA8D&username=administrator%26

{"error": "Field not specified."}
```
Adding field parameter seems to change the output application
```
csrf=jc2oxIEzr20v1a3YSb2etjKVENEiJ3aA&username=administrator%26field=a%23
{"type":"ClientError","code":400,"error":"Invalid field."}
```
Trying a few field types shows that password is not one of them. I wrote my [own tool](https://github.com/theballmarcus/theballmarcus-payloads/blob/main/tools/burp_to_wfuzz) to bruteforce different parameters using wfuzz:

It doesn't yield anything important.
However taking a look at ```/static/js/forgetPassword.js``` shows that reset_token might be a valid param.
Sending `field=reset_token` yields `o847h68g7t9nb1vnaxx6k0kw6cdtuxmg`

Going to ```/forgot-password?reset_token=o847h68g7t9nb1vnaxx6k0kw6cdtuxmg``` in browser allows us to change the administrator password

Then we can login and delete carlos to win.
